Cloud computing;
Computing resources are made available as a service

Important Chars for Cloud; 
-On Demand and Self service {Any time launch without manual Intervention}
-Elasticity(Scalability) {can scale up/down any time provided when its stopped}
-Measured Service {Pay for what you used}

Cloud computing models;

Software as service (SaaS)
Platform as service (PaaS)
Infrastructure as service (Iaas)

High Level Architecture of Cloud computing ;

Virtual Servers |  								On Demand and Self service

Data Center     | 								Pay per use

**Scalability**;
--Horizontal Scalability
		If you need to upgrade 2 GB RAM to 8GB capacity, include 3 more server with 2GB RAM
	Cons;
		Can't be used in Database applications. Vertical scalability is preferred. 
--Vertical Scalability 
		If you need to upgrade 2 GB RAM to 8GB capacity, it is done in a single server.
	Cons;	
		If server goes down, it will stop promotions(business) Horizontal scalability is refereed. 
		
AUTO SCALING;
	-Auto scaling functionality for horizontal scalabilty is one of the AWS which can scale up/down based on the CPU requirement with thershold values.
	-Max 5 servers/instances

***CANNOT SCALE THE SERVERS WITHOUT SHUTTING DOWN SERVER IF DOING VERTICALLY**

Characteristics of CSP (Cloud service provider);
Automated creating instance using GENKIN's job.

On Demand Challenges;
Limited resource for a Data center. To aviod 'insuffient capactiy' we need to have reserved servers suggested by CSP.
